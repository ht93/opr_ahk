# User Manual

### Pre
1. Please copy `opr.exe`, `windowspy.exe`, `dup.png`, `coor.txt` and `save.bmp` to a new directory and open `opr.exe`.
2. The `coor.txt` is fit to my setup (**Chrome**\ **1920x1080**\ Windows `scale and layout` with `100%`). Even the same setup does not mean it would work. Please adjust it to fit your own setup by `Ctrl+Shift+o`.
3. To adjust the coordinate, please use the `windowspy.exe` and use the Relative mode for coordinate update. Please make sure that you have selected your web browser.
4. Once you have your own coordinate `coor.txt` with `Ctrl+Shift+o`, please make a copy of the `coor.txt` (like `coor_backup.txt` in same directory). The program may cause some number during some of my test run. Just copy the backup and rename it back, you will still be good.

### Control
- `Ctrl+Shift+o`: set up the coordinate (automatically update the `coor.txt`), and enable or disable the whole function
- `Ctrl+Shift+p`: User manual and current state
- `z`: 1 star

- `x`: 2 star (not very good)
- `s`: 2 star (ordinary and bad location)
